For this you will refer to your prior occupation assignment. You are encouraged to re-use and refactor code as necessary.
Your (duo) job:
**Write a Flask app** with an "/occupyflaskst" route, which will generate an HTML page with
an appropriate title,
a descriptive heading,
your team name and roster,
and a tablified version of the occupations data, along with
a randomly selected occupation shown at the top.
 
- **Simplicity is divine.**
- Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code)
- Name your main driver **app.py**
- File this under **10_occ** in your workshop.
- Use QAF liberally.

If you're feeling flasky, and you've completed the requirements above, try this on for size:
- For each occupation, find a link that would be helpful to get started in that field.
- Add that link to the occupations.csv file.
- Include the link in the python dictionary you create 
* *(Note: you'll have to store the percentage and the link as values attached to each name)* *
- When Your flask app renders the page, include the link to help your users on their way to their new job.
