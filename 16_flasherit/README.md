K #16: Oh yes, perhaps I do…  
Due M 2019-10-07, 08:00, EST.

Your (duo) job:

**Refactor and augment your last flask app** to incorporate flashing and template inheritance.

Specifications/Guidelines:
- Each page of your site should have
   - a header section (title, etc)
   - a body section (meaningful msg to user…)
   - a footer section (perhaps copyright teamname, eg)
- In the root of your flask app folder, make directory “doc” and store in it
   - “sitemap.jpg” -- your KtS-based site map
   - “teamflag.jpg” -- your glorious team flag
- File this under 16_flasherit in your workshop. (Both Devos.)

Protips:
- Simplicity is divine.
- Diagnostic print statements are your friend.
   - Use them liberally.
   - When not in use, comment out rather than delete.
- Pay close attention to Flask console during development.
- Use your browser's developer console to gain a sense of cookie behavior (in general, start familiarizing yourself with this dev console…)
- Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code)
- Use QAF liberally.
