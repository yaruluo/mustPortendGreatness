1. As a duo, create a new flask app.
2. Venture out into Ye Olde SoftDev API Knowledge Base and find an interesting REST API card created by a Devo in another section.
3. Using their card as a guide, hook into said API with your flask app. (i.e., display an image, pull some text, etc.)
4. Edit card as necessary, add your name to the contributors list, update last-edited date.
5. Repeat steps 2-4.
6. Repeat steps 2-4.
