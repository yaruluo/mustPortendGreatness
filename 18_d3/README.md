# K18: Come Up For Air

Due **T 2020-04-21 08:00** EST

Estimated time required: <=60min

Step 0. Process collective learnination from last work.

1. Find a dataset in CSV or JSON format that is
   - manageable,
   - interesting, and
   - befitting a transitional representation.
   - *E.g.*, population in a given area, by year.
2. Whip up a new flask app to visualize this data.
   - Landing page will have a “Render” button, but no visualization of data, (yet). When Render button is clicked, your data set will appear in your favorite representation.
   - A Transition button will facilitate transitioning to… the data for the next year, another state, etc. (Include visible text on the page to indicate this.)
   - You may add more transitions if you like…

Save to workshop under `18_d3`.
