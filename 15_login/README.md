Your (duo) job:

**Write a flask app** that uses session capabilities to allow a user to login and logout.

Specifications/Guidelines:

- Hardcode a single username/password combination.
- HTML form send​s​ data to Flask app.
- form target should check the credentials, and render either a welcome page or an error page.
- If login fails, then a message should explain what went wrong (bad password? bad username? bad juju?).
- Root route either
  - a) loads a login page, if there is no user logged in, or
  - b) loads a welcome page, if the user is logged in.
- Welcome page (for successful login) should have a logout button that goes to a separate route that will log the user out of the session.
- When a user logs in, a session should be established with the username stored.
- Addendum: In the root of this flask app folder, make directory “doc” and store in it
  - “sitemap.jpg” -- your KtS-based site map
  - “teamflag.jpg” -- your glorious team flag
- Name your main driver app.py
- File this under 15_login in your workshop. (Both Devos.)

Protips:
- Simplicity is divine.
- Diagnostic print statements are your friend.
  - Use them liberally.
  - When not in use, comment out rather than delete.
- Pay close attention to Flask console during development.
- Use your browser's developer console to gain a sense of cookie behavior (in general, start familiarizing yourself with this dev console…)
- Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code)
- Use QAF liberally.
