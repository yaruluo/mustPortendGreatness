Due **R 2019-12-12**, 08:00, EST.

As a new duo...

(*pair programming highly advised*)

PHASE II:

1. Duplicate your last workdir.
2. Modify HTML+JS such that...
   - A button is displayed for each of the phase 1 functions.
   - Clicking each button calls the corresponding function.
     - (You may choose args; if so, display them on the button face.)
     - Log each function's output to the console.
     - If possible, display each function's output on the page.
   - You may want to craete helper functions or external list variables here.
   - Do whatever you think is needed. Think: S I M P L E. Think: S M A R T.

Guidelines:

- Note anything notable.
  - Pay attention to error messages.
  - Get more familiar with the browser's dev console.
  - Use your QAF: share discoveries, ask Qs.
- File this under `28_jsdom` in your workshop.
  - This folder sohuld contain your HTML and JS files.
  - You and your partner should have identical code in your folders for this work.
