    <div class="greeting">
      Try to memorize this:
      <br> <br>
      To be, or not to be? That is the question—
      <br>
      Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
      <br>
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
      <br>
      Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
      <br>
      And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—
      <br>
      No more—and by a sleep to say we end
      <br>
      The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
      <br>
      That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation
      <br>
      Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.
      <br>
      To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,
      <br>
      For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
      <br>
      When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
      <br>
      Must give us pause. There’s the respect
      <br>
      That makes calamity of so long life.
      <br>
      For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
      <br>
      Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
      <br>
      The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
      <br>
      The insolence of office, and the spurns
      <br>
      That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,
      <br>
      When he himself might his quietus make
      <br>
      With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
      <br>
      To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
      <br>
      But that the dread of something after death,
      <br>
      The undiscovered country from whose bourn
      <br>
      No traveler returns, puzzles the will
      <br>
      And makes us rather bear those ills we have
      <br>
      Than fly to others that we know not of?
      <br>
      Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
      <br>
      And thus the native hue of resolution
      <br>
      Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
      <br>
      And enterprises of great pitch and moment
      <br>
      With this regard their currents turn awry,
      <br>
      And lose the name of action. —Soft you now,
      <br>
      The fair Ophelia! —Nymph, in thy orisons
      <br>
      Be all my sins remembered.
