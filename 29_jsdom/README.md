As a new duo…

(*pair programming highly advised*)

PHASE III:

1. Procure dommy.html (see workshop repo-of-holding).
2. Write a JavaScript file that will do the following:
   - Upon button push, add an element to the list.
   - When the mouse goes over an item in the list, change the heading at the top to contain the text of the item.
   - When the mouse is no longer over an item in the list, change the heading back to "Hello World!"
   - When an item on the list is clicked, remove it from the DOM.
You may want to create helper functions or external list variables here.
   - Do whatever you think is needed. Think: S I M P L E.   Think: S M A R T.

PHASE IV:

- Add a second list to the html page. Do not add elements to it.
- Create a second button.
- When the second button is pressed,
  - add a new item to your list, showing the next Fibonacci number.
- Beyond!: add more lists that generate other sequences…

Guidelines:

- Note anything notable.
  - Pay attention to error messages.
  - Get more familiar with the browser's dev console.
  - Use your QAF: share discoveries, ask Qs.
- File this under `29_jsdom` in your workshop.
  - This folder should contain your HTML and JS files.
  - You and your partner should have identical code in your folders for this work.
