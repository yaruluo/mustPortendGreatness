K12: Connect the Dots
Mar 26, 2020

Due M 2020-03-30 08:00 EST
Estimated time required: <=60min
let us have some more happy trees

Recreate your connect-the-dots HTML5/JS program using SVG instead of the canvas.

Each time the user clicks inside the SVG area, a circle should be drawn.
After the first circle, every subsequent click should also result in a line from from the previous circle to the next.
Include a clear button. (Note: clearRect() will not work; it is a canvas method. You need to remove all the circles somehowâ€¦)

Save to workshop under 12_svg-dot.
